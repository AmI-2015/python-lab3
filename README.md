# Python - Lab 3

Python exercises proposed in the third lab, about the usage of [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
They built upon the first two exercises of the previous lab ([https://github.com/AmI-2015/python-lab2](https://github.com/AmI-2015/python-lab2)) and share the same requirements.

The additional packages required for this project are reported in the `requirements.txt` file.

See [http://bit.ly/polito-ami](http://bit.ly/polito-ami) for further information.
